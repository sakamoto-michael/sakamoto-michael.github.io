    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>Hey! Thank you for visiting my page. My name is Michael Sakamoto. I am a new graduate with a Bachelor's Degree in Computing from Queen's University (Ontario, Canada). Currently, I am looking for my next exciting and challenging role.</p>

    <h5>Developers' Foundation</h5>
    <p class="overview">
      Outside of classroom projects, my first developer experience was with the <a href="https://developersfoundation.ca/" target="_blank">Developers' Foundation</a> (at Queen's University).
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      Mentored by the team at the Western University branch, I gained experience in planning, developing, and deploying polished webpages (for non-profit organizations). I worked together with clients to develop reasonable requirements for each project. I learned not only about fundamental web development skills, but also about design principles, professional client interaction, and team-oriented thinking to empower other organizations.
    </p>
    <h5>Celestica Inc.</h5>
    <p class="overview">
      Entering the industry, I became an intern of the IT Analytics team at <a href="https://www.celestica.com/" target="_blank">Celestica</a>, a multinational business-to-business corporation.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      To say that this internship experience was valuable would be an understatement. There were endless learning opportunities. I was able to collaborate with both local and international teams from various departments on impactful projects. I pushed for various responsibilities, including coding for the company's analytics platform, project managing, training users, as well as being an intermediary between the analytics team and business/supply chain teams. I also partook in Celestica's mentorship program, where I learned about project and time management skills, as well as programming with modern technologies to solve diverse company problems.
