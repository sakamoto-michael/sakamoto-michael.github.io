        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p class="overview">
          Outside of classroom projects, my first "real-life" experience was with the <a href="https://developersfoundation.ca/" target="_blank">Developers' Foundation</a> (at Queen's University).
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          Mentored by the team at the Western University branch, I gained experience in planning, developing, and deploying polished webpages (for non-profit organizations). I worked together with clients to develop reasonable requirements for each project. I learned not only about fundamental web development skills, but also about design principles, professional client interaction, and team-oriented thinking to enable new opportunities for other organizations.
        </p>
        <p class="overview">
          Entering the industry, I became a part the IT Analytics team at <a href="https://www.celestica.com/" target="_blank">Celestica</a>, a multinational business-to-business corporation.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          To say that this internship experience was valuable would be an understatement. There were endless learning opportunities. I was able to collaborate with both local and international teams from various departments on impactful projects. I pushed for various responsibilities, included coding for the company's analytics platform, project managing, training users, as well as being an intermediary between the analytics team and business/supply chain teams. I also applied to join Celestica's mentorship program, where I learned project and time management skills, as well as programming with modern technologies to solve diverse company problems.
